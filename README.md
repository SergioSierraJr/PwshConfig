# PwshConfig
My powershell configuration files, includes some custom functions.
Also comes with a theme that it should be used with, its heavily 
inspired by the dracula powershell theme. Powershell config should
be used on Windows as it will not work on a GNU/Linux system because
a certain function requires notepad to be installed.
